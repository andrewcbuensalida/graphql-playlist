Stack: graphql, mongodb atlas, react on aws amplify front end, node on ec2 backend,
I'm for hire. email andrewcbuensalida@gmail.com
trying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buh3GjHPmjo for cicd from github to ec2
cors anywhere creator is having problems. had to click a button to temporarily enable it.
just realized node server had to have a running process for application stop to not crash
and theres a delay in the deploment logs
node adds another running server everytime i deploy without pkill
cicd goes all the way until the last step. had to manually go into ec2 and serve client
no more need for amplify because of cors expiration.
